# Progress

## 1. What Works

*   **API Request Parity:** The agent has been refactored to achieve API request parity with the TypeScript agent. This involved several key changes:
    *   **In-Prompt Tool Emulation:** The `ApiHandler` was modified to remove the native `tools` parameter, and a new XML parser was implemented in `parsers.py` to handle tool responses from the model's text output.
    *   **System Prompt Replication:** The system prompt from the TypeScript agent was ported to `claude4_prompt_template.py` and integrated into the `prompts.py` module.
    *   **Environment Context Replication:** The `environment.py` module was enhanced to gather and format environment context in the same way as the TypeScript agent.
*   **Core Agentic Loop:** The agent is fully functional as a lightweight, backend-only library, implementing the core synchronous loop (prompt, API call, tool use, repeat).
*   **CLI-Native Plan/Act Mode:** A robust Plan/Act mode, tailored for a command-line workflow, separates planning from execution. Mode switching is handled via explicit user commands (`/plan`, `/act`).
*   **Refactored Context Management:** The `ContextManager` has been refactored to use dependency injection for its API client and now uses the correct method for token counting, making it more robust and testable.
*   **Basic Tools:** A foundational set of tools for file I/O and command execution is available.
*   **Testing and Packaging:** The agent has a complete unit test suite and is packageable via `setup.py`.
*   **Comprehensive Divergence Analysis:** A deep-dive analysis comparing the Python and TypeScript agents has been completed and documented in `agent/memory-bank/deviations.md`. This clarifies the significant architectural differences between the two implementations.

## 2. What's Left to Build

The primary goal is to refactor the Python agent to achieve API request parity with the TypeScript agent. The work is defined by the plan in `activeContext.md`. Key remaining gaps to be addressed in the future include:

*   **Advanced Context Management:** The current `ContextManager`'s truncation logic is still very basic. Replicating the production agent's sophisticated, state-aware truncation strategies is a major future effort.
*   **Advanced Tool System:** The tool system needs to be enhanced to support features like dynamic registration and user approval flows.
*   **Persistent State Management:** A comprehensive system for saving and loading the entire agent state, including checkpoints, is needed.
*   **Asynchronous Operations and Streaming:** The agent needs to be refactored to support non-blocking operations and stream responses.
*   **VSCode-Specific Context:** Features that rely on direct IDE integration (like monitoring open tabs and active terminals) are deferred. Their limitations are documented in `systemPatterns.md`.

## 3. Current Status

The agent has been successfully refactored to achieve API request parity with the production Cline extension. It now uses in-prompt tool emulation instead of native tool use. The agent is stable and well-tested, and its core components are well-documented in the memory bank.

## 4. Known Issues

*   **Basic Context Truncation:** The agent's context management uses a simple truncation strategy that is not as effective as the production version for preserving important information in long conversations. This is the most critical known issue limiting its ability to handle complex, multi-turn tasks.
*   **Feature Subset:** The agent's functionality is still a subset of the production Cline extension. It lacks a UI, streaming, full state persistence, and dynamic tool integration (MCP). This is by design but should be noted.
